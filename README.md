# Postman collections from training
I will keep the Postman collections I built for training in this repo.

####  List of collections:
**1. GitHub API** \
*Followed this online [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ) to learn how to use Postman with the Github API.* \
**2. Deck of Cards** - Simple Blackjack game (built together with Martin) \
*Shuffle 6 decks, draw 4 cards, assigning 2 to dealer and 2 to player. The one with highest sum and less or equal to 21 wins.* \
**3. Marvel API** - Simple fighting game \
*It fetchs one X-men series ID and uses it to get all the characters from that series.* \
*The "Get Character" run was to learn and implement setNextRequest() to repeat this step to get 2 characters and their total number of series. The results were logged, but this method updates the previous character's details so I could not compare them for the "fight". I ended up creating the runs "Get Character 1" and "Get Character 2" to fetch their data and select a winner based on the number of series.*
